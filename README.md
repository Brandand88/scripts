# dotfiles

This repo includes stuff for my build server, MacBook Pro, and other Linux instances. I'll try to update this for what each thing is/does

## Linux

+ **.bashrc:** my home bashrc file which includes some Git aliases and functions for basic functions on my box
+ **motd.sh:** my MOTD script (placed in /etc/profile.d and touch ~/.hushlogin to suppress last login message)
+ **config:** my neofetch configuration file for my build server, placed in ~/.config/neofetch/config

## Mac

+ **.bash_profile:** my home .bash_profile file, which holds most of the same things as .bashrc
+ **config:** my neofetch configuration file for my MacBook Pro, placed in ~/.config/neofetch/config
+ **com.googlecode.iterm2.plist**: My iTerm2 settings

## Common

+ **vim:** my personal vim settings
+ **Makefile:** Makefile for testing colors in terminal (run make)
+ **.tmux.conf:** my personal tmux settings
