# OS Things

This repo includes stuff for my build server, MacBook Pro, and other Linux instances. I'll try to update this for what each thing is/does

## Linux
    + **.bashrc:** my home bashrc file which includes some Git aliases and functions for basic functions on my box
    + **motd.sh:** my MOTD script (placed in /etc/profile.d and touch ~/.hushlogin to suppress last login message)
    + **config:** my neofetch configuration file for my build server, placed in ~/.config/neofetch/config
    + **.vimrc:** my personal vim settings
    + **Makefile:** Makefile for testing colors in terminal (run make)

## Mac
    + **.bash_profile:** my home .bash_profile file, which holds most of the same things as .bashrc
    + **config:** my neofetch configuration file for my MacBook Pro, placed in ~/.config/neofetch/config
    + **Makefile:** Makefile for testing colors in terminal (run make)
    + **com.googlecode.iterm2.plist**: My iTerm2 settings
