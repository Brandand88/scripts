# OS Things

This repo includes stuff for my build server, MacBook Pro, and other Linux instances. I'll try to update this for what each thing is/does

1. Linux/.bashrc: my home bashrc file which includes some Git aliases and functions for basic functions on my box
2. Linux/motd.sh: my MOTD script (placed in /etc/profile.d and touch ~/.hushlogin to suppress last login message)
3. Linux/config: my neofetch configuration file for my build server, placed in ~/.config/neofetch/config
4. Linux/.vimrc: my personal vim settings
5. Mac/.bash_profile: my home .bash_profile file, which holds most of the same things as .bashrc
6. Mac/config: my neofetch configuration file for my MacBook Pro, placed in ~/.config/neofetch/config
